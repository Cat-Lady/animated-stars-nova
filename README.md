## Features

- Every star system was hand-tweaked for the star to match lore/star type of vanilla Endless Sky.
 
- Full integration with dynamic fuel/solar energy gathering.


## Installing

Check:
https://github.com/Cat-Lady/animated-stars-nova/releases

...for latest, pre-packaged version.

**1.** Unpack ``animated-stars-nova`` to your ES plugins folder. Be sure that you have single ``animated-stars-nova`` directory inside your plugins folder, containing ``data`` and ``images`` folder. Directory structure should look like:

```(...)/plugins/animated-stars-nova/(.../data/, /images/ and other stuff)```


It **won't** work if the directory structure will be anything like:

```(...)/plugins/animated-stars-nova/animated-stars-nova/(...)```
